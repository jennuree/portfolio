            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>What’s the role of a portfolio? To show a designer’s final products? Or the process? Accomplishments? A portfolio does all those things, but I believe the portfolio itself should be well thought out and polished, just like the works inside of it. The portfolio itself should be a piece of art in itself, and that’s why I decided to build it- from scratch. (Let’s test those coding skills!)

                    <h3>Emphathize</h3>
                    <h4><i>Learning about the audience</i></h4>

                    <p>In order to design my website to best fit its visitors, I considered who would be visiting my website:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Designers - <i>inspire them!</i></li>
                        <li>Recruiters - <i>intrigue them!</i></li>
                        <li>Possible clients - <i>delight them!</i></li>
                    </ul>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>As a designer, I often visit other designers’ portfolio sites. Here are some insights from my experience (notes I gave myself!):
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Keep things minimal- Most designers limit their navigation tabs to just “About Me,” “Works,” and “Contact.” Those with more menu options reserve them for different types of work, like Illustrations. 
                        </li>
                        <li>Your work should be visible right when you enter the site, before even clicking or scrolling - My personal preference. 
                        </li>
                        <li>Make sure you use legible fonts and size
                        </li>
                        <li>Short intro on the main page! People can go to your About tab if they want to learn more about you, but you should tell them what you do when they first open your website.
                        </li>
                        <li>Put your best work at the top
                        </li>
                        <li>Image with title for your works/case studies - having to hover over images to read what they’re about was a bit inconvenient for my liking</li>
                        <li>Put adequate spacing in between different sections and projects  - When they’re too close together, it appears cluttered.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>In order to understand what someone without a design background would look for in a design portfolio, I interviewed Andy, who works in talent acquisition. 
                    </p>
                    <p>Takeaways:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Everything should be categorized and easy to find</li>
                            <li>Contact should be easily accessible</li>
                            <li>Use fonts that are easy to read</li>
                            <li>Relevant work only</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>

    </div>
    <div class="define">
        <div class="img-container">
        <img src="images/phase2.png" alt="phase 2" class="phase-img"> 
        </div>
                    <h3>Define</h3>
                    <h4><i>Identify users' needs</i></h4>
                    <p>In order to help my visitors find what they are looking for, I came up with a priority list:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>At first glance, my portfolio should scream “UX DESIGNER!” (UX work priority! As someone with a graphic design and illustration background, there are works I could flood my portfolio with)
                        </li>
                        <li>It should be easy to navigate - About Me, Works, Contact. - Always available in the navigation bar.   
                        </li>
                        <li>Case studies: Make them skim-able. Not everyone will read the whole thing, probably… but it should be easy to go through your design process.
                        </li>
                        <li>Invite them to contact you. In case they want to reach out for collaborations, questions, or even offers.
                        </li>
                        <li>Add a touch of <i>personality</i></li>
                    </ul>

            </div>
                <p>I sketched up the most simplistic design I could think of, with only the necessary information on the website.</p>
                <p>I had a lot of ideas, but had to consider what I could code myself at my level. I am always practicing and trying to 
                    improve, so I look forward to being able to design more complex websites in the future.

                    <h3>Prototype</h3>
                    <h4><i>Transforming ideas</i></h4>
                    <p>Coding has been something I have always been interested in, and being able to put together my 
                        own design into a live website was both exciting and challenging.
                    </p>
                    <p>I started out with the html, laying out all the contents of my website.</p>
                    <div class="img-container">
                        <img src="images/code2.png" alt="code image 2" class="img">
                    </div>
                    <p>Coding css gave me a lot of issues, because a lot of things did not work the way I expected it to. 
                        However, after a lot of trial and error, I got the website looking like how I wanted it.
                    </p>
                    <div class="img-container">
                        <img src="images/code1.png" alt="code image 1" class="img">
                    </div>

                    <p>I hope to refine my coding skills in a more professional setting someday! </p>

                    <h3>Test and repeat</h3>
                    <h4><i>Evaluate and test</i></h4>

                    <p>The final product is the website you are looking at!</p>
                    
                    <p>In order to gain some feedback, I went back to interview Andy (who I interviewed initially).
                        He stated that the home page was nice and simple with a nice accent color. As someone without 
                        a design background, he found it still aesthetically pleasing. 
                    </p>
                <p>In the future, I hope to get a lot of feedback from recruiters once I start actively applying 
                    to UX positions. Recruiters and fellow designers, I welcome all feedback! Thank you for reading.
